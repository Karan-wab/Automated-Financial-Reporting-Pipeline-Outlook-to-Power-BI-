# Automated-Financial-Reporting-Pipeline-Outlook-to-Power-BI-

 Designed and implemented an end-to-end automated workflow to streamline daily financial reporting using entirely free tools and services. Utilized Outlook
 mail rules and Power Automate to extract and store over 25 daily survey files from emails into Google Drive, replacing manual downloads. Developed a
 Python script integrated with the Google Drive API to consolidate and clean the datasets, significantly reducing errors and processing time. Loaded the
 processed data into Power BI, where I used Power Query to transform and model the data. Built a dynamic dashboard with insights such as average annual
 income, credit utilization, age-based credit score segmentation, and LTV (Lifetime Value)-based customer promotion targeting. This automation improved
 delivery speed and accuracy of client reports for the US government.
